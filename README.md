# Analyzing Adidas Sales: Identifying Factors for Increased Profitability Using Statistical Approach
## Overview
This repository contains the analysis of Adidas sales from January 2020 to December 2021. The aim of this analysis is to identify the factors that affect sales and profits, and provide insights and recommendations for increasing sales and profits. The analysis is conducted using statistical approaches, such as t-test, regression analysis, and data visualization using Python programming language and its libraries.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is provided on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heemalichaudhari/adidas-sales-dataset) and contains information about units sold, total sales, operating profit, sales method, and product category for each region and retailer. The dataset is in excel format and can be found in the '**data**' folder.

## Files in Repository
- **README.md**: provides an overview of the analysis and its results.
- **Adidas_Sales_Analysis.ipynb**: a Jupyter Notebook containing the code used for the analysis.
- **data**: a folder containing the dataset used in the analysis.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The analysis shows that the product with the most unit sales is "Men's Street Footwear" with around 593,320 units sold. Overall sales from January 2020 to December 2021 at outlets or in-stores are still a significant sales method for most retailers. Selling products with a price per unit above the average generates a higher profit compared to selling products with a price per unit below the average.

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the business should adjust its pricing strategy to focus on higher-priced products to increase profits. The business should also consider implementing a discount strategy for low-performing products to increase sales. Additionally, the business should focus on increasing the online sales method in the Midwest and Southeast regions to take advantage of its dominance in those areas.
